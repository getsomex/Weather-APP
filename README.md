# Weather-APP
# Using 2 APIs for this app
    1. for coordinates - Mapbpox API
    2. for forecast- Dark Sky API

# geocode.js 
    - given a address. It will give me the data with langtitude and latitude of that address
# forecast.js
    - passing the langtitude and latitude(from geocode). It will give current weather forecast data.

# API-calling
    - for api call i am using 'request' npm package. 
    Reason:  dont have to write lots of unneccessary codes. But you can do with built in node-fetch method or other methods.

NOTE: This whole thing i learned from one of my course. It is pretty easy and hopefully it will be helpful for those who are learning node! And a great practice to work with api.

Any suggestions to improve this code are always welcome.
